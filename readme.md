Website for my band New China. React webpages are rendered with CCS3DRender on to the face of a cube with a WebGL background (inspired by mrdoob's threejs water example).

You'll need the three js files specified in `template.ejs` (from Three.js). In `GPUComputationRender.js`, change `renderer` to `waterrenderer`

To run the dev server, run `node .\server.js`
